JavaScript - II

## MVP

- [ ] Callbacks
- [✅] Array Methods
- [✅] Closures

## Stretch

- [ ] Cool extra stuff

## What Looks Great

- Almost done with MVP
- Code is well formatted and easy to read

## What Could Be Improved

- MVP needs to be completed - console.log() and read through callbacks.js again.
- Need more commits. You should have one commit for every one change.
- Commits need more description. Check out this guide (https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

## What Could Be Added

- `console.log()` the results in the callbacks section
