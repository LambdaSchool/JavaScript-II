// ==== Challenge 1: Write your own closure ====
// Write a simple closure of your own creation.  Keep it simple!
const dog = 'blaise';
function returnBlaise () {
  return dog;
}
returnBlaise(); 


// ==== Challenge 2: Create a counter function ====
const counter = () {
  let count = o;

  const addCounter = () {
    return ++count;
  }
  return addCoutner;
};

const newCounter = counter();
console.log(newCounter());
console.log(newCounter());

/* STRETCH PROBLEM, Do not attempt until you have completed all previous tasks for today's project files */

// ==== Challenge 3: Create a counter function with an object that can increment and decrement ====
const counterFactory = () => {
  // Return an object that has two methods called `increment` and `decrement`.
  // `increment` should increment a counter variable in closure scope and return it.
  // `decrement` should decrement the counter variable and return it.
};
