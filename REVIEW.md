JavaScript - II

## MVP

- [✅] Callbacks
- [✅] Array Methods
- [✅] Closures

## Stretch

- [ ] Cool extra stuff

## What Looks Great

- MVP complete! Nice work
- Code is well formatted and easy to read

## What Could Be Improved

- Take a look at some of the array methods. You will want to be returning an array, and not just console.log()-ing each time the .forEach() loop runs.
- Need more commits. You should have one commit for every one change.
- Commits need more description. Check out this guide (https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
- Code needs better formatting
- Files need better organizational structure
